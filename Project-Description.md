#Project Description
- Team Name: Exploiter
- Students: Robert Deal (CS) (dealre@mail.uc.edu)
- Topic Area: Prepared Cyber Attack Tooling

A generalized description of the intended project is to write a program that can interact with exploits in a set of targeted devices and conduct small cyber attacks like grabbing data, implanting malware, and other such effects. The end result will be a table demonstration with a set of devices and a QR code for people to download an app on their phone and conduct these attacks themselves against a set of stock office or home equipment to see how vulnerable these devices are, and what a prepared attacker can do against them. The goal is to show off what I've learned in the cyber security field while at the same time hopefully providing a real and tangible example of how some devices can be maliciously interacted with and raise awareness of the dangers of complacency in modern devices.
