Examples:
- As a penetration tester, I want to be able to use this program to attempt to compromise the security of my system with a credible attack so I can verify it works as intended.
- As a low-skill cyber attacker, I want to be able to use this program without too much complexity or required knowledge so I can compromise software.
- As a cyber defender, I want to understand how cyber attacks work and be able to use this program as a example to learn from in a simple manner so I can learn to prevent things like it.
- As an average person, I want to understand how dangerous cyber attacks can be in reality and how even simple attacks could present a risk to me and my security so I can take actions to mitigate my risks.
