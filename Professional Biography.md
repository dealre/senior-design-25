## Experience
- Worked Professionally for ICR Inc. in Mason, Ohio
- Did general programming work
- Conducted RE work on specific target devices
- Worked on penetration testing tools
- Created tests for said tool base

## Project

- I plan on creating an example penetration tool app that can easily be used to exploit a specifically designated device with little to no instruction/training.
- The goal would be to have a final demonstration for the project that has a QR code that links to a downloadable program that people at the expo can use on their phones to interact with a number of devices that have been reverse engineered and searched for exploits that result in real world effects
- an example would be a small isolated network likely consisting of a router, a printer, a laptop, a camera, or other IOT devices. The goal would be to create the Application so that the targets can be scanned, targeted, and sent payloads that can extract data from them, upload malicious software, or conduct other actions that break the built-in firewalls and other defenses that the specific devices have
- While the project would focus on the creation of the application and the reverse engineering of the target devices, it would also act as a wonderful demonstration of how a prepared attacker could violate safety systems in office/professional environments and highlight the otherwise abstract and misunderstood effects of malware.
